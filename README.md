# BCB420: Computational Systems Biology

The main focus of this couse was gene expression analysis with R.\
One dataset from [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) was selected individually and its consequent processing and analysis was done on R.

## Dataset Info
Publication Title: Disruption of the MBD2-NuRD complex but not MBD3-NuRD induces high level HbF expression in human adult erythroid cells\
Publication Date: 2019 Dec\
Publication Journal: Haematologica\
GEOID: GSE121992\
\
This study was able to prove that the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase complex member MBD2 knock-out in primary human erythroid cells were able to significantly elevate the gamma/gamma+beta mRNA expresssion of HbF, which has shown to benefit sickle cell anemia patients.\
RNA-sequencing of the MBD2KO and the control (sgCSR) cells pre- and post- differentiation was performed to measure the effect of MBD2KO in erythroid differentiation.\
They found that MBD2KO in primary human erythroid cells significantly elevate the gamma/gamma+beta mRNA expresssion of HbF without changing the morphological appearance after differentiation compared to controls. From this finding, the authors proposed that therapies targeting MBD2 can ameliorate the underlying pathophysiological defects in sickle cell anemia and beta (beta)-thalassemia.
